* Cloud Security Engineer
* Systems Engineer (Cloud)
* Cloud Developer
* Cloud Architect
* Network Engineer (Cloud)
Major Types Of Cloud Engineers
The three major categories are:
* Solutions Architect
* Cloud Developer
* System Operations Engineer
Based on the above categories Cloud Engineer roles and responsibilities may vary. Let me throw some light on each of these roles:
Solutions Architect
These are the individuals who will be involved in designing the infrastructure and applications. Therefore, they must possess advanced technical skills and experience in designing distributed applications and systems on the Cloud platform. Simply speaking, they are responsible for creating blueprints of application designs.
These are some of their responsibilities:
* Designing and deploying dynamically scalable, available, fault-tolerant, and reliable applications on the Cloud
* Selecting appropriate Cloud services to design and deploy an application based on given requirements
* Migrating complex, multi-tier applications on Cloud Platforms
* Designing and deploying enterprise-wide scalable operations on Cloud Platforms
* Implementing coCloud Developer
* It is pretty clear from the title that these individuals are responsible for coding and development of applications. They are expected to have knowledge of the best practices related to Cloud architecture. Cloud Developers are also involved in developing, deploying, and debugging cloud-based applications. They are expected to have:
* Expertise in at least one high-level programming language
* Skills for developing, deploying & debugging cloud applications
* Skills in API usage, command line interface and SDKs for writing applications
* Knowledge of key features of Cloud Service Providers
* Understanding of application lifecycle management
* Ability to use continuous integration and distribution pipelines to deploy applications
* Ability to code to implement essential security measures
* Skills in writing, correcting and debugging code modules
* Code writing skills for serverless applications
* Understanding in the use of containers in development processes
System Operations Engineer
These individuals are system administrators who take over once the application is designed and developed. They are responsible for managing and monitoring most of the activities that follow the process of development. They should possess the following skills:
* Relevant experience as a systems administrator in a systems operations role
* Ability to work with virtualization technology
* Experience in monitoring and auditing systems
* Knowledge of networking concepts (e.g., DNS, TCP/IP, and firewalls)
* Ability to translate architectural requirements
* Ability to deploy, manage, and operate scalable, highly available, and fault-tolerant systems
* Knowhow to implement and control the flow of data, to and from a service provider
* Capability to select the appropriate services based on compute, data, or security requirements
* Abiity to estimate usage costs and identify operational cost control mechanisms
* Capability to migrate on-premises workload to service providers
